<P>
There are two different ways of playing streams in MIDAS Digital Audio System:
stream file playback and polling stream playback. In stream file playback,
MIDAS creates a new thread that will read the stream data from a given file
and plays it automatically on the background. In polling stream playback the
user needs to read or generate the stream data, and feed it to MIDAS.
<P>
Stream files are played with <EM>MIDASplayStreamFile</EM> and
<EM>MIDASplayStreamWaveFile</EM>. Both functions require as arguments the
stream file name, stream playback buffer length and stream looping flag. The
files played with <EM>MIDASplayStreamFile</EM> should contain only raw sample
data, and the function will therefore require as arguments also the stream
data sample type and playback rate. <EM>MIDASplayStreamWaveFile</EM> plays
RIFF WAVE files, and can read the information from the file header. The
playback functions will return a stream handle that can be used to refer to
the stream.
<P>
Polling stream playback is started with <EM>MIDASplayStreamPolling</EM>. It
requires as its arguments the stream sample type, playback rate and buffer
length. The actual stream playback will not start, however, until some stream
data is fed to the system with <EM>MIDASfeedStreamData</EM>. After the
playback has starter, <EM>MIDASfeedStreamData</EM> needs to be called
periodically to feed the system new stream data to play, otherwise the system
will run out of stream data and stop playback.
<P>
The stream playback buffer length controls the amount of stream data buffered
for stream playback. The longer the buffer is, the longer the system can play
the stream when new data is not available until the playback needs to be
stopped. Running out of stream data will result in irritating breaks in the
sound and should be avoided. Longer playback buffers will, however, add delay
to the stream playback, and consume more memory. For stream file playback, a
stream buffer length of 500ms should be suitable. For polling stream
playback, the buffer length should be at least twice the longest expected
delay between two calls to <EM>MIDASfeedStreamData</EM>.
<P>
Stream playback is stopped with <EM>MIDASstopStream</EM>, regardless of the
stream type.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00461000000000000000">3.6.1 Controlling stream playback</A></H2>
<P>
The stream playback properties can be changed while it is being
played. <EM>MIDASsetStreamRate</EM> can be used to change its playback rate,
<EM>MIDASsetStreamVolume</EM> its volume and <EM>MIDASsetStreamPanning</EM>
its panning position. All of these functions take as an argument the stream
handle from the stream playback function, and the new value for the playback
property.
<P>
The playback of the stream can also be paused with <EM>MIDASpauseStream</EM>,
and resumed after pausing with <EM>MIDASresumeStream</EM>. This can be useful
if your application knows it will run out of stream data soon, and wishes to
fade the stream out and pause it until more data is available. Stream data
reading and feeding can continue while the stream is paused until the stream
buffer is full.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00462000000000000000">3.6.2 Getting stream information</A></H2>
<P>
The amount of data currently in the stream buffer can be monitored with
<EM>MIDASgetStreamBytesBuffered</EM>. The information could be used to
determine how soon new stream data is needed to continue playback, or whether
or not enough space exists in the stream buffer for a complete new block of
data.
<P>
Note that with ADPCM streams the stream buffer contains the decompressed data,
as 16-bit samples, instead of the compressed ADPCM data.
