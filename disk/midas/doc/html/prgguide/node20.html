<H1><A NAME="SECTION00510000000000000000">4.1 Optimizing MIDAS performance</A></H1>
<P>
Although MIDAS Digital Audio System has been carefully optimized for maximum
performance, playing multichannel digital audio can still be fairly
time-consuming. To get around the limitations of current PC sound cards, MIDAS
needs to mix the sound channels in software, and this mixing process accounts
for most of CPU usage caused by MIDAS. In many cases tradeoffs can be made
between sound quality and CPU usage, although it is also possible in some
cases to lower CPU usage dramatically without affecting sound quality.
<P>
In some cases the opposite is also true: It can be possible to get better
sound quality out of MIDAS without using much additional CPU power. This
section therefore describes how you can get best possible sound quality of
MIDAS while using as little CPU time as possible, and how to find the right
balance between sound quality and CPU usage for your application.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00511000000000000000">4.1.1 The number of channels</A></H2>
<P>
First and foremost, the CPU time used for mixing depends on the number of
active sound channels in use. Each channel needs to mixed to the output
separately, and thus requires CPU time. Note, however, that the total number
of open channels is not very significant, only the number of channels that are
actually playing sound. Also, sounds played at zero volume take very little
CPU time.
<P>
On a computer with a 90MHz Pentium CPU, with the default sound quality
settings, the CPU time used is roughly 0.6%-0.9% of the total CPU time per
channel. The number can vary greatly depending on the type of samples used and
other factors, but can be used as a guideline in deciding how many sound
channels to use. Regardless of the output mode settings, however, minimizing
the number of channels used is an easy way to increase MIDAS performance.
<P>
Using fewer sound channels does not necessarily mean sacrificing sound quality
or richness. Music modules do not necessarily need to have over 10 channels to
sound good -- talented musicians have composed stunning songs with the Amiga
Protracker program which only supports 4 channels. Unnecessary or very quiet
sound effects could be eliminated, making way for more important
ones. Finally, instead of playing two or more sounds simultaneously, the
sounds could be mixed beforehand with a sample editor into one.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00512000000000000000">4.1.2 Sample types</A></H2>
<P>
Another factor that has a great effect on MIDAS Digital Audio System CPU usage
is the type of the samples played. The simplest sample type, and therefore the
fastest to play, is a 8-bit mono sample. 16-bit samples take typically 50%
more CPU time to play than 8-bit samples, and stereo samples more than 50%
than corresponding mono samples. In addition, ADPCM streams take additional
CPU time for decompressing the ADPCM data to 16-bit before it can be played.
<P>
However, 16-bit samples do sound much better than 8-bit ones. A good
compromise is to use <I>mu</I>-law samples instead. <I>mu</I>-law samples have almost
the same sound quality as 16-bit samples, while being as fast to mix as 8-bit
samples. In addition, they only take as much space as 8-bit samples, and thus
lower the memory requirements of the program as well. In some mixing modes
MIDAS will actually automatically convert 16-bit samples to <I>mu</I>-law if it is
beneficial. The option
<EM>MIDAS_OPTION_16BIT_ULAW_AUTOCONVERT</EM>
can be used to control this behaviour.
<P>
ADPCM compression yields a 1:4 compression on 16-bit sound data, using
effectively only 4 bits per sample, while maintaining sound quality better
than 8-bit samples. As ADPCM sample data cannot easily be played without
decompressing it first, however, MIDAS only supports ADPCM sample data in
streams. Although ADPCM streams take somewhat more CPU time to play than
16-bit streams, as the data needs to be decompressed, they can still turn out
to be faster in practise, as the amount of data that needs to be read from
disk is much smaller.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00513000000000000000">4.1.3 Output settings</A></H2>
<P>
Finally perhaps the most important factor in determining MIDAS CPU usage and
sound quality: output sound quality settings. Several different sound quality
settings can be adjusted, and each can be used to adjust the balance of sound
quality and CPU usage.
<P>
The most important of all output quality settings is the mixing mode. By
default, MIDAS Digital Audio System uses normal mixing mode, which has very
good performance. High-quality mixing mode with sound interpolation is
available, and it greatly enhances the sound quality in some cases, but also
requires much more CPU power. High-quality mixing can use two to three times
as much CPU time as normal quality mixing, and should be reserved for
applications that only use a few sound channels or do not require the CPU time
for other uses. The mixing mode settings can be changed by setting the option
<EM>MIDAS_OPTION_MIXING_MODE</EM> with
<EM>MIDASsetOption</EM>.
<P>
Another setting that greatly affects CPU usage and sound quality is the output
mixing rate. CPU usage depends almost linearly on the mixing rate, with higher
mixing rates using more CPU power but also sounding better. The default mixing
rate is 44100Hz, but in many cases it can be lowered to 32000Hz or 22050Hz
without too great sound quality loss. In addition, if all of your sounds are
played at the same rate (eg. 22050Hz), the mixing rate should be set at the
same rate -- using a higher rate would not bring any better sound quality and
could actually increase noise in the output.
<P>
Experimenting with different mixing rate and mode combinations can also be
worthwhile, as in some cases using a lower mixing rate with high-quality
mixing can sound better than a higher mixing rate with normal quality.
<P>
The last setting to consider is the output mode setting. The output mode
should normally be set to a 16-bit mode, as using 8-bit modes does not
decrease CPU usage, only sound quality. If the sound card used doesn't support
16-bit output, MIDAS will use 8-bit output automatically. Using mono output
instead of stereo, however, can decrease CPU usage by up to 50%. Therefore,
if your application does not use stereo effects in its sound output, consider
using mono output mode instead. The output mode can be changed by setting the
option <EM>MIDAS_OPTION_OUTPUTMODE</EM> with
<EM>MIDASsetOption</EM>.
