What? 
- A little DOS "port" of an old Desire Amiga 500 music disk (ChipChop #16).

For? 
- 486 DX (or Dosbox, you twinks). 4MB+ RAM. ~200KB free disk space (temporarily, those who know, know why). Any acceptable VGA card.

By? 
- Megahawks INC.

With? 
- All tracks from the original Megahawks INC. music disk #1 as a bonus.

Why? 
- Because you're welcome.

Imperfections? 
- Plenty, maybe I'll fix them. Probably not.

Credits? 
- Just run the disk.
- And MIDAS and MiniLZO and Watcom and PMODE/W by the usual suspects.
