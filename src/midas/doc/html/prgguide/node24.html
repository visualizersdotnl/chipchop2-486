<H1><A NAME="SECTION00610000000000000000">5.1 Using DirectSound</A></H1>
<P>
Beginning from version 0.7, MIDAS Digital Audio System supports DirectSound
for sound output.  Although most of the time this is done completely
transparently to the user, there are some decisions that need to be made in
the initialization phase.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00611000000000000000">5.1.1 Initialization</A></H2>
<P>
By default, DirectSound support in MIDAS Digital Audio System is disabled. To
enable it, set
<EM>MIDAS_OPTION__DSOUND_MODE</EM> to a value
other than <EM>MIDAS_DSOUND_DISABLED</EM>.  The
DirectSound mode you choose depends on the needs of your application, and the
available modes are described in detail in the next section.
<P>
In addition to the DirectSound mode, you also need to set the window handle
that MIDAS will in turn pass to DirectSound. DirectSound uses this window
handle to determine the active window, as only the sound played by the active
application will be heard. To set the window handle, simply call
<PRE>        MIDASsetOption(MIDAS_OPTION_DSOUND_HWND, (DWORD) hwnd);</PRE>
where <B>hwnd</B> is the window handle of your application's main
window.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00612000000000000000">5.1.2 DirectSound modes</A></H2>
<P>
Apart from <EM>MIDAS_DSOUND_DISABLED</EM>, three
different DirectSound modes are available in MIDAS Digital Audio System. This
section describes them in detail.
<P>
<B>MIDAS_DSOUND_STREAM</B>: DirectSound stream mode. MIDAS will play its
sound to a DirectSound stream buffer, which will then be mixed to the primary
buffer by DirectSound. If the DirectSound object hasn't explicitly been set,
MIDAS will initialize DirectSound and set the primary buffer format to the
same as MIDAS output format. This mode allows arbitrary buffer length, and
possibly smoother playback than primary buffer mode, but has a larger CPU
overhead.
<P>
<B>MIDAS_DSOUND_PRIMARY</B>: DirectSound primary buffer mode. The sound
data will be played directly to the DirectSound primary buffer. This mode has
the smallest CPU overhead of all available DirectSound modes, and provides
smallest possible latency, but is not without its drawbacks: The primary
buffer size is set by the driver, and cannot be changed, so the buffer size
may be limited.
<P>
<B>MIDAS_DSOUND_FORCE_STREAM</B>: This mode behaves exactly like the
stream mode, except that DirectSound usage is forced. Normally, MIDAS will
not use DirectSound if it is running in emulation mode (as the standard
Windows WAVE output device will provide better performance), so this mode
must be used to force DirectSound usage. Forcing MIDAS to use DirectSound in
stream mode will also the applications to use DirectSound themselves
simultaneously.
<P>
By default, MIDAS an automatical fallback mechanism for DirectSound modes: If
DirectSound support is set to primary mode, but primary buffer is not
available for writing, MIDAS will use stream mode instead. And, if
DirectSound is running in emulation mode, MIDAS will automatically use normal
Win32 audio services instead. This way it is possible to simply set the
desired DirectSound mode, and let MIDAS decide the best of the alternatives
available.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00613000000000000000">5.1.3 Buffer sizes</A></H2>
<P>
When MIDAS Digital Audio System is using DirectSound with proper drivers
(ie. not in emulation mode), much smaller buffer sizes can be used than
normal. Because of this, the DirectSound buffer size is set with a different
option setting --
<EM>MIDAS_OPTION_DSOUND_BUFLEN</EM> -- from the
normal mixing buffer length.  When playing in emulation mode, MIDAS will use
the normal mixing buffer length, as smaller buffers can't be used as reliably.
<P>
Selecting the correct buffer size is a compromise between sound latency and
reliability: the longer the buffer is, the greater latency the sound has, and
the longer it takes the sound to actually reach output, but the smaller the
buffer is made, the more often the music player needs to be called. To ensure
that there are no breaks in sound playback, the music player needs to be
called at least twice, preferably four times, during each buffer length: for
a 100ms buffer, for example, the sound player needs to be called at least
every 50ms, or 20 times per second.
<P>
Although the calling frequency requirements don't seem to be very severe, in
practise trying to guarantee that a function gets called even 20 times per
second can be difficult. The realtime capabilities of the Win32 platform,
especially Windows 95, leave a lot to be desired: A 16-bit program or system
service can easily block the system for long periods of time. By default,
MIDAS uses a separate thread for background playback, but although this
thread runs at a higher priority than the rest of the program, you may find
that using manual polling will help you get more consistent and reliable
sound playback.
<P>
Unfortunately there is no single buffer size that works for everybody, so
some experimentation will be needed. The default MIDAS DirectSound buffer
size is 100ms, which should be a reasonable compromise for most applications,
but, depending on your applications, buffer sizes at 50ms or below should be
usable.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00614000000000000000">5.1.4 Using other DirectSound services with MIDAS</A></H2>
<P>
If necessary, it is also possible to use other DirectSound services
simultaneously with MIDAS Digital Audio System. In this case, MIDAS should be
set to use DirectSound in forced stream mode, and the DirectSound object needs
to be explicitly given to MIDAS before initialization:
<PRE>        MIDASsetOption{MIDAS_OPTION_DSOUND_OBJECT, (DWORD) ds);</PRE>
Where <B>ds</B> is a pointer to the DirectSound object used, returned by
<EM>DirectSoundCreate()</EM>. The user is also responsible for setting
DirectSound cooperative level and primary buffer format.
<P>
Although this DirectSound usage is not recommended, it can be used, for
example, to play music with MIDAS while using the DirectSound services
directly for playing sound effects.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00615000000000000000">5.1.5 When to use DirectSound?</A></H2>
<P>
Although DirectSound provides a smaller latency than the normal Windows sound
devices, and possibly smaller CPU overhead, it is not suitable of all
applications. This section gives a quick overview on what applications should
use DirectSound, what shouldn't, and which DirectSound mode is most
appropriate.
<P>
The most important drawback of DirectSound is, that only the active
application gets its sound played. While this can be useful with games that
run fullscreen, it makes DirectSound completely unusable for applications
such as music players, as background playback is impossible with DirectSound.
Therefore standalone music player programs should never use DirectSound.
<P>
Also, if your application does not benefit from the reduced latency that
DirectSound provides, it is safer not to use DirectSound. The DirectSound
drivers currently available are not very mature, and the DirectX setup
included in the DirectX SDK is far from trouble-free. In addition, programs
using DirectSound need to distribute the DirectX runtime with them, making
them considerably larger.
<P>
However, if you are writing an interactive high-performance application,
where strict graphics and sound synchronization is essential, DirectSound is
clearly the way to go. For these kind of applications, DirectSound primary
buffer should be the best solution, unless there are clear reasons for using
stream mode.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00616000000000000000">5.1.6 DirectSound and multiple windows</A></H2>
<P>
When the application uses DirectSound for sound output, only the sound from
the active window is played. Therefore DirectSound requires a window handle
to be able to determine which window is active. If the application has
multiple windows that it needs to activate separately, however, this can
cause problems. DirectSound provides no documented way to change the window
handle on the fly.
<P>
To get around this problem, MIDAS Digital Audio System provides two functions
to suspend and resume playback: <EM>MIDASsuspend</EM> and
<EM>MIDASresume</EM>.  <EM>MIDASsuspend</EM> stops all sound playback,
uninitializes the sound output device, and returns it to the operating system.
<EM>MIDASresume</EM> in turn resumes sound playback after suspension. These
functions can be used to change the DirectSound window handle on the fly:
First call <EM>MIDASsuspend</EM>, set the new window handle, and call
<EM>MIDASresume</EM> to resume playback. This will cause a break to the
sound, and the sound data currently buffered to the sound output device will
be lost.
<P>
Depending on the application, it may also be possible to get around the
DirectSound multiple window problem by creating a hidden parent window for
all windows that will be used, and pass the window handle of that parent
window to DirectSound.
