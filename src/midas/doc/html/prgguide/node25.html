<P>
This section describes how MIDAS Digital Audio System uses the MS-DOS system
timer, and how to install user timer callbacks. This information is not
relevant in other operating systems.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00621000000000000000">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
To be able to play music in the background in MS-DOS, and to keep proper
tempo with all sound cards, MIDAS needs to use the system timer (IRQ 0,
interrupt 8) for music playback. Because of this, user programs may not
access the timer directly, as this would cause conflicts with MIDAS
music playback. As the system timer is often used for controlling
program speed, and
running some tasks in the background, MIDAS provides a separate user
timer callback for these purposes. This callback should used instead of
accessing the timer hardware directly.
<P>
The callbacks can be ran at any speed, and can optionally be
synchronized to display refresh.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00622000000000000000">5.2.2 Using timer callbacks</A></H2>
<P>
Basic MIDAS timer callback usage is very simple: Simply call 
<EM>MIDASsetTimerCallbacks</EM>, passing it the desired callback rate
and pointers to the callback functions. After that, the callback
functions will be called periodically until 
<EM>MIDASremoveTimerCallbacks</EM> is
called. <EM>MIDASsetTimerCallbacks</EM> takes the callback rate in
milliHertz (one thousandth of a Hertz) units, so to get a callback that 
will be called 70 times per second, set the rate to 70000. The callback
functions need to use <B>MIDAS_CALL</B> calling convention
(<TT>__cdecl</TT> for Watcom C, empty for DJGPP), take no
arguments and return no value.
<P>
For example, this code snippet will use the timer to increment a variable
<B>tickCount</B> 100 times per second:
<P>
<PRE>    void MIDAS_CALL TimerCallback(void)
    {
        tickCount++;
    }
    ...
    MIDASinit();
    ...
    MIDASsetTimerCallbacks(100000, FALSE, &amp;TimerCallback, NULL, NULL);
    ...</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00623000000000000000">5.2.3 Synchronizing to display refresh</A></H2>
<P>
The MIDAS timer supports synchronizing the user callbacks to display
refresh under some circumstances. Display synchronization does not work
when running under Windows 95 and similar systems, and may fail in SVGA
modes with many SVGA cards. As display synchronization is somewhat
unreliable, and also more difficult to use than normal callbacks, using
it is not recommended if a normal callback is sufficient.
<P>
To synchronize the timer callbacks to screen refresh, use the following
procedure:
<P>
1. <B>BEFORE</B> MIDAS Digital Audio System is initialized, set up the display
mode you are going to use, and get the display refresh rate corresponding to
that mode using <EM>MIDASgetDisplayRefreshRate</EM>. If your application uses
several different display modes, you will need to set up each of them in turn
and read the refresh rate for each separately. If
<EM>MIDASgetDisplayRefreshRate</EM> returns zero, it was unable to determine
the display refresh rate, and you should use some default value
instead. Display refresh rates, like timer callback rates, are specified in
milliHertz (1000*Hz), so 70Hz refresh rate becomes 70000.
<P>
2. Initialize MIDAS Digital Audio System etc.
<P>
3. Set up the display mode
<P>
4. Start the timer callbacks by calling
<EM>MIDASsetTimerCallbacks</EM>. The first argument is the refresh
rate from step 1, second argument should be set to TRUE (to enable display
synchronization), and the remaining three arguments are pointers to the
<B>preVR</B>, <B>immVR</B> and <B>inVR</B> callback
functions (see descriptions below).
<P>
5. When the callbacks are no longer used, remove them by calling 
<EM>MIDASremoveTimerCallbacks</EM>.
<P>
When you are changing display modes, you must first remove the existing
timer callbacks, change the display modes, and restart the callbacks
with the correct rate. Please note that synchronizing the timer to
the screen update takes a while, and as the timer is disabled for that time
it may introduce breaks in the music. Therefore we suggest you handle the
timer screen synchronization before you start playing music.
<P>
If MIDAS is unable to synchronize the timer to display refresh, it will
simply run the callbacks like normal user callbacks. Therefore there is
no guarantee that the callbacks will actually get synchronized to
display, and your program should not depend on that. For example, you
should not use the timer callbacks for double buffering the display, as
<B>preVR</B> might not be called at the correct time -- use triple
buffering instead to prevent possible flicker.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00624000000000000000">5.2.4 The callback functions</A></H2>
<P>
<EM>MIDASsetTimerCallbacks</EM> takes as its three last arguments three
pointers to the timer callback functions. These functions are:
<P>
<EM>preVR()</EM> -- if the callbacks are synchronized to display refresh,
this function is called immediately <B>before</B> Vertical Retrace
starts. It should be kept as short as possible, and can be used for
changing a couple of hardware registers (in particular the display start
address) or updating a counter.
<P>
<EM>immVR()</EM> -- if the callbacks are synchronized to display refresh,
this function is called immediately after Vertical Retrace starts. As
<EM>preVR()</EM>, it should be kept as short as possible.
<P>
<EM>inVR()</EM> -- if the callbacks are synchronized to display refresh,
this function is called some time later during Vertical Retrace. It can
take a longer time than the two previous functions, and can be used, for
example, for setting the VGA palette. It should not take longer than a
quarter of the time between callbacks though.
<P>
If the callbacks are not synchronized to display refresh, the functions
are simply called one after another. The same timing requirements still
hold though.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00625000000000000000">5.2.5 Framerate control</A></H2>
<P>
DOS programs typically control their framerate by checking the Vertical
Retrace from the VGA hardware. If MIDAS is playing music in the
background, this is not a good idea, since the music player can cause
the program to miss retraces. Instead, the program should set up a timer
callback, possibly synchronize it to display refresh, use that callback
to increment a counter, and wait until the counter changes.
<P>
For example:
<P>
<PRE>    volatile unsigned frameCount;
    ...
    void MIDAS_CALL PreVR(void)
    {
        frameCount++;
    }
    ...
    MIDASsetTimerCallbacks(70000, FALSE, &amp;PreVR, NULL, NULL);
    ...
    while ( !quit )
    {
       DoFrame();
       oldCount = frameCount;
       while ( frameCount == oldCount );
    }</PRE>
<P>
Note that <B>frameCount</B> needs to be declared <B>volatile</B>,
otherwise the compiler might optimize the wait completely away.
<P>
A similar strategy can be used to keep the program run at the same speed
on different computers. You can use the frame counter to determine how
many frames rendering the display takes, and run the movements for all
those frames before rendering the next display.
