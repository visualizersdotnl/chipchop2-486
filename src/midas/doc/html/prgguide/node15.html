<H1><A NAME="SECTION00440000000000000000">3.4 Using samples</A></H1>
<P>
Using samples is the easiest way to add sound effects and other miscellaneous
sounds to a program with MIDAS Digital Audio System. This section describes
how samples are used in MIDAS.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00441000000000000000">3.4.1 Loading samples</A></H2>
<P>
Before samples can be used, they naturally need to be loaded into
memory. MIDAS Digital Audio System currently supports samples in two formats:
raw audio data files and RIFF WAVE files. Raw sample files can be loaded with
<EM>MIDASloadRawSample</EM>, and RIFF WAVE samples with
<EM>MIDASloadWaveSample</EM>. Both functions require as arguments the name of
the sample file, and sample looping flag -- 1 if the sample should be looped,
0 if not. <EM>MIDASloadRawSample</EM> also requires the sample type as an
argument, <EM>MIDASloadWaveSample</EM> determines it from the file
header. Both functions return a sample handle of type
<EM>MIDASsample</EM> that can be used to refer to the sample.
<P>
After the samples are no longer used, they should be deallocated with
<EM>MIDASfreeSample</EM>. You need to make sure, however, that the sample is
no longer being played on any sound channel when it is deallocated.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00442000000000000000">3.4.2 Playing samples</A></H2>
<P>
Samples that have been loaded into memory can be played with the function
<EM>MIDASplaySample</EM>. It takes as arguments the sample handle, playback
channel number, and initial values for sample priority, playback rate, volume
and panning. The function returns a MIDAS sample playback handle of type
<EM>MIDASsamplePlayHandle</EM> that can be used to refer to the sample as it
is being played. A single sample can be played any number of times
simultaneously.
<P>
Sample playback can be stopped with <EM>MIDASstopSample</EM>, but this is not
necessary before the sample will be deallocated -- a new sample can simply be
played on the same channel, and it will then replace the previous one. The
sample handles will be recycled as necessary, so there is no danger of memory
leaks.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00443000000000000000">3.4.3 Samples and channels</A></H2>
<P>
One sound channel can be used to play a single sample, and therefore
<EM>MIDASplaySample</EM> requires the number of the channel that is used to
play the sample as an argument. The channel number can be set manually, or
MIDAS Digital Audio System can handle the channel selection automatically.
<P>
If the channel number for the sample is set manually, the channel used should
be allocated with <EM>MIDASallocateChannel</EM> to ensure that the channel is
not being used for other purposes. If a free channel is available, the
function will return its number that can then be used with
<EM>MIDASplaySample</EM>. After the channel is no longer used, it should be
deallocated with <EM>MIDASfreeChannel</EM>.
<P>
Another possibility is to let MIDAS select the channel automatically. A number
of channels can be allocated for use as automatic effect channels with
<EM>MIDASallocAutoEffectChannels</EM>. <EM>MIDASplaySample</EM> can then be
passed <B>MIDAS_CHANNEL_AUTO</B> as the channel number, and it will
automatically select the channel that will be used to play the effect. After
the automatic effect channels are no longer used, they should be deallocated
with <EM>MIDASfreeAutoEffectChannels</EM>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00444000000000000000">3.4.4 Controlling sample playback</A></H2>
<P>
Most sample playback properties can be changed while it is being
played. <EM>MIDASsetSampleRate</EM> can be used to change its playback rate,
<EM>MIDASsetSampleVolume</EM> its volume, <EM>MIDASsetSamplePanning</EM> its
panning position and <EM>MIDASsetSamplePriority</EM> its playback
priority. All of these functions take as an argument the sample playback
handle from <EM>MIDASplaySample</EM>, and the new value for the playback
property.
<P>
The sample playback properties can be changed at any point after the sample
playback has been started until the sample playback is stopped with
<EM>MIDASstopSample</EM>. If the sample has reached its end, or has been
replaced by another sample with automatic channel selection, the function call
is simply ignored.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00445000000000000000">3.4.5 Getting sample information</A></H2>
<P>
The sample playback status can be monitored with
<EM>MIDASgetSamplePlayStatus</EM>. It takes as an argument the sample
playback handle, and returns the current sample playback status. The playback
status information can be used to determine whether or not a sample has
already reached its end.
